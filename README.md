# POC

This PoC is created by considering a Service Cloud environment that has no access to any Sales Cloud feature.

For exercise 1, I built a LWC displayed on the Case Record Page that shows key data to the user about the Customer Product.

For exercise 2, I create a REST resource that enables an external system to access data of the Customer Product.

Tests take into account positive and negative scenarios where data may be missing.
